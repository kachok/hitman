------ SCRIPTS -------

buffer_update.py - take results out of buffer and read into relevant esl2 tables (should be run after running multi_test, since requires full buffer)

reloadall.sh - runs cleanup.py, cleardb.py, load_data_to_db.py in that order. recommended using instead of running individually, since it will avoid accidentally clearing DB before removing hits from mturk.
