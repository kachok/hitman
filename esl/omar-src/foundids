the conclusion is that Taliban with there deeds making the work easier for World Power

war in Afghanistan is going from past 15 years

this is right that war, is a destructive way it never solves problems instead it increases it.

Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence which Nelson Mandela uses in South Africa

rejuventaing depopulated areas is important in some parts of Scotland but I cannot see how seccession solves this?Immigrants have come to these shores in droves (predominantly a good thing in my view) and they have caused issues in some towns due to the sheer impact on local services.

what will you going to do at Prime Minister's statement

please give us your opinion

American President George W Bush in his last Press conference advises newly elected President that he did many mistakes in his tenure and Barack Obama should do what he think is right

I as the President and according with the constitution of USA and law i did the developments, i put forward American interest on my own popularity.

If the Scottish National Party is paying attention to these developments, it should be encouraged, I venture to suggest, by what it may discover in so doing.
